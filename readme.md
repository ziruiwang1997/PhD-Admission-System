    The PhD Admission System is used by the admission committee to review all the graduate school application profiles and
    make admission decisions accordingly. The customer wants a G-Suite Google App Script based system for evaluating PhD 
    applicants. It is needed that data in EngineeringCAS can be pulled into the system with improved automation. 
    Besides, more functionalities are needed in the system such as more sorting and filtering options. The customer also 
    requires the results of admission decisions can be feedbacked automatically into the Webadmit.org. It is optional that 
    the faculty can be notified when the applicants are nominated and when new applicants are added.
